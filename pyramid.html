      <h1>Why people form pyramid hierachies</h1>

      <p>
        In observing the behavior of any group of social animals, one thing that stands out is, a pyramid shaped social hierarchy
        will eventuall form. This is so common that we take it for granted. Of course there's always a hierachy - why would't 
        there be? When things are common, we stop asking why they are there, but wouldn't it be nice to find an explanation?
      </p>

      <p>
        The big reason to try to explain common behavior is that there must be some value in it. If a person wants to accomplish
        something, such as build the next big app, they invariably must form a group to achieve their goal. Whether they succeed 
        or not has a lot do with how they manage to create that group - whether it's successful recruitment, appropriate
        delegation, or common characterics amongs its members.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why social hierachies exist then is an important question, and today we try to answer from the perspective of data science.

        Dimensional Complexity 
      </h2>

      <p>
        In data science, dimensional complexity means how many varaibles are we considering when we train our model. Let's say 
        we are training a model to predict Igor's favorite car. We have four in this sample cars: 
      </p>

      <pre>
+-----------+-------------+---------------+
|   make    |    year     |     model     |
+-----------+-------------+---------------+
| Ford      | 1998        | Taurus        |
| Toyota    | 1997        | Camry         |
| Honda     | 2000        | Accord        |
| Tesla     | 2019        | Model S       |
+-----------+-------------+---------------+
      </pre>

      <p>
        Igor chose the Honda Accord from this sample, and we can use that information on other samples. Every time we add a row 
        to the data set, we increase the work we have to do linearly. When we add another column, it's a different story. Let's 
        say we add color.
      </p>

      <pre>
+-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------+
|   make    |    year     |     model     |   color        |
+-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------+
| Ford      | 1998        | Taurus        | Red            |
| Toyota    | 1997        | Camry         | Blue           |
| Honda     | 2000        | Accord        | Yelow          |
| Tesla     | 2019        | Model S       | Green          |
+-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------+
      </pre>

      <p>
        To try to predict by color, our model has to consider the year, model, and make as well. Yellow on a honda may do it 
        for him, but not on a Tesla. Adding another dimension other problem increases our computation costs exponentially.
