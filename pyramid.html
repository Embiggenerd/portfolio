      <h1>Why people form pyramid hierachies</h1>

      <p>
        In observing the behavior of any group of social animals, one thing that stands out is, a pyramid shaped social hierarchy
        will eventuall form. This is so common that we take it for granted. Of course there's always a hierachy - why would't 
        there be? When things are common, we stop asking why they are there, but wouldn't it be nice to find an explanation?
      </p>

      <p>
        The big reason to try to explain common behavior is that there must be some value in it. If a person wants to accomplish
        something, such as build the next big app, they invariably must form a group to achieve their goal. Whether they succeed 
        or not has a lot do with how they manage to create that group - whether it's successful recruitment, appropriate
        delegation, or common characterics amongs its members.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why social hierachies exist then is an important question, and today we try to answer from the perspective of data science.

      <h2>
        Dimensional Complexity 
      </h2>

      <p>
        In data science, dimensional complexity means how many varaibles are we considering when we train our model. Let's say 
        we are training a model to predict Igor's favorite car. We have four in this sample cars: 
      </p>

      <pre>
+-----------+-------------+---------------+
|   make    |    year     |     model     |
+-----------+-------------+---------------+
| Ford      | 1998        | Taurus        |
| Toyota    | 1997        | Camry         |
| Honda     | 2000        | Accord        |
| Tesla     | 2019        | Model S       |
+-----------+-------------+---------------+
      </pre>

      <p>
        Igor chose the Honda Accord from this sample, and we can use that information on other samples. Every time we add a row 
        to the data set, we increase the work we have to do linearly. When we add another column, it's a different story. Let's 
        say we add color.
      </p>

      <pre>
+-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------+
|   make    |    year     |     model     |   color        |
+-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------+
| Ford      | 1998        | Taurus        | Red            |
| Toyota    | 1997        | Camry         | Blue           |
| Honda     | 2000        | Accord        | Yelow          |
| Tesla     | 2019        | Model S       | Green          |
+-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------+
      </pre>

      <p>
        To try to predict by color, our model has to consider the year, model, and make as well. Yellow on a honda may do it 
        for him, but not on a Tesla. Adding another dimension increases our computation costs exponentially.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Dimensional complexity of every day life
      </h2>

      <p>
        Let's say you have a long commute to work. Today, there's something wrong with your car. You have to shift to first 
        gear for your breaks to work. Not a problem you say. If you concentrate really hard, you can do it. Let's also say 
        you have to have to turn your wheel twice as much to turn your car left as you did before. If you concentrate more 
        than you ever have, and you also get lucky, you may make it. Add a screaming, hungry kid to the back seat, and may 
        you rest in peace. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Our ability to deal with dimensional complexity is pretty bad. When work applications ask for 3 years of experience 
        for a junior dev role, what this says is that we are so bad at dealing with new variables, the only way around it is 
        experience - practice, day and in and day out,for years in dealing with particilar variables in order not to screw 
        everything up.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        But, driving a car is a lone task, and does not require a group of people. Let's say you are building a house. You 
        hired Chau to wire electricity, Mary to lay the bricks, and Pendleton to do the plumbing. If the Pendleton starts too 
        soon, Mary won't be able to lay the bricks. If Mary lays the bricks incorrectly, Chau can not do his work. Each 
        person is a dimension you have to worry about. Every time you add a person, you increase the dimensional complexity 
        of building a house. 
      </p>

      <p>
        How do people who build skyscrapers manage to succeed? If you have 5 brick layers, and 3 electricians, you hire 
        someone to manage all the brick layers, and someone to manage the electricians. Your dimensional complexity then 
        remains 3, though you've increased your team by 8. Your team also looks like a pyramid - large at the base, but small 
        at the top.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dealing with complexity does not stop at building houses - in fact, it is one thing all tasks, group or individual, 
        have in common. Some work has to get done. Some orchestration of the workers must take place, and that work in itself 
        must be done by workers. This naturally forms a pyramid structure. How many 'levels' there are in a pyramid, vs nodes 
        at each level is determined hour brains' capacity to handle dimensional complexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        What can be explained from this perspective on group behavior? 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Incombents have an unfair advantage.
      </h2>

      <p>
        If Rodrigo the plumber wants to join Igor's house buildling company, where is he going to plug into the pyramid? Going 
        to Igor, Igor says my hands are full. Going to Igor's plumbing manager, Ben, he says I got enough to worry about. Going to 
        one of the plumbers, Pendleton, is tough because Rodrigo and Pendleton are competitors for the same position. For 
        Pendleton to be promoted to manager, there must be too many plumbers for Pendlton's manager to handle. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        New members of  a group are constatly being added to the bottom, and whoever was there earliest has the advantage, 
        regardless of skill. If Ridrigo is a better plumbing manager than Ben the incombent, Igor still has to deal with the
        complexity of a new employee he doesn't know. It's not enough that Rodrigo is better, he will likely have to be added 
        to the bottom regardless. From an evolutinary standpoint, this helps to explain mortality.
      </p>
