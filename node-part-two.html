      <h1>How node actually works, part 2: the eventÂ loop</h1>
      <p>
        How much could one more inch hurt? We're talking about having confidence in
        Javascript interviews, and what do you say when you're asked "what is node",
        or "how does node handle asynchronous code". How node talks to the operating system
        is explained in 
        <a href="https://medium.com/@igor.atakhanov/how-node-actually-works-part-1-the-operating-system-497fd0de8167">
        part one.
        </a> Now that we know we are receiving a multiplexed stream
        of file descriptors which are ready to be read from or written to, we
        are ready to talk about what we do with those fds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before asynchronous code, there was synchronous code.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Synchronous Code
      </h2>

      <p>
        So far all you really know about how Javascript scripts are executed is roughly the order in which 
        things happen. Let's take a look at an example script, and what our steps our computer takes to do 
        the work we want it to do.
      </p>

      <pre>
          1. const a = () => {
          2.   console.log('hi')
          3.   return
          4. }
          5. const b = () => {
          6.   a()
          7.   console.log('planet') 
          8.   return
          9. }
        10. a()
        11. b()
        12. console.log('all done')
      </pre>

      <p>
        Our CPU has to worry about more than just the console logs, it has to worry about the order of instructions
        that it carries out. The first line it cares about is 10, and then it will want to look up the definition of
        a, which really starts at line two. When it returns, we then skip to line 11. How does our CPU keep track of
        that? How does it know to go back to 11?
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's divide our system memory into two parts:
      </p>

      <img src="article-images/memoryDiagram.png" />

      <p>
        Before you get confused, here's what everything means: our memory is a zero indexed structure. We load up our
        instructions starting at index 0. These instructions are similar to our javascript code, but not exactly. They 
        the machine code we talked about earlier that our JS gets translated into. Call
        and return get their own instructions, and beside those, we only call stdout. These are the 'real' instructions
        that any human readable language gets translated into. It's called machine code, and each instruction string 
        is associated with a binary CPU instruction, which is different for every instruction set. This structure grows 
        up, and it is a first in, first out queue.
      </p>


      <p>
        Starting at index 240, we have a stack. This stack grows down, which is confusing, and means that when we push
        onto the stack, we have to decrement the index which is the 'top' of the stack, which we call the stack pointer,
        or SP. When we pop, we will increment it. Our total memory, which is split between the queue and the stack 
        only goes to index 255, which makes it an 8 bit CPU emulator. Above index 240, we have locations where we can 
        store things we don't have to worry about today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most importantly, the index of the currently executing instruction is stored in the program counter, or PC. A
        part of our flow of execution is decrementing the PC to execute the next instruction, of course unless our
        instruction specifically sets the PC to something else, which we will discuss next.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <b>call</b> instruction does two things.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Decrements the SP.</li>
        <li>
          It pushes the return address onto the stack. This is a reference to the instruction we should execute after
          the current function returns.
        </li>
        <li>
          It sets PC to the current instruction's definition. This is really a reference to the first instruction in the
          definition.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Here's what our memory looks like after we run call on line 10:
      </p>

      <img src="article-images/memoryDiagram_1.png" />

      <p>
        We have the SP point to line 11 in the stack, and our PC points to line 2. We execute line two, which prints
        'hi' to
        the user, and set PC to the return on line 3. People don't ordinarily put explicit returns at the end of void
        functions, but here we are trying to be really transparent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <b>return</b> instruction
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Pops the return address off the stack at the SP.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stores the return address in the PC.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increments the SP.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our stack currently only has line 11 on it, so we pop it, and point the PC to it. At this point, our SP is
        pointing
        to an empty memory[240], and or PC is at memory[239]. That instruction happens to be line 12, which is an
        stdout,
        and our PC will point to line 6, which is another call. Here's how those two steps look.
      </p>

      <img src="article-images/memoryDiagram_2.png" />

      <img src="article-images/memoryDiagram_3.png" />

      <p>
        A nested function causes our stack to grow to size 2, and now we are starting to see the point of the stack. The
        user will see a second 'hi', then 'planet', then 'all done', as we reach return statements in our script.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is the point of explaining how an 8 bit CPU emulation could handle a JS script? When we say a function is
        blocked, we mean to say that a return statement of the last function hasn't been executed, and our PC does not 
        point to our blocked function in order to execute it. We are blocked because the stack operations and the script's 
        functions
        are all in the same thread of execution. We can't risk placing network calls into this queue in the order in which
        they appear in the code, because who knows how long that will block. In order for asynchronous code to work, we 
        have to curate the order that
        instructions are executed in. The queue in our memory we will call a message queue, and the problem is how to 
        execute asynchronous instructions so that they don't get in the way of synchronous code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's say thet we want to make a call to a google maps API in our code to get some location data for a store.
      </p>

      <p>
        The classic solution is to use a thread to wait on the response, and when the call comes in on the other thread,
        we
        interrupt the current thread, and insert our data into the message queue. However, as we discussed in the
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/@igor.atakhanov/acid-mvcc-and-how-postgresql-handles-concurrent-queries-27fb48692db8">
          previous article
        </a>
        , we avoid threads because of the memory requirements and the latency overhead of context switching. The nice thing 
        about threads is that you don't need a schedular. When a thread comes back with some data, we interrupt our main thread,
        and place that data into our message queue. Without threads, we need a scheduler and a way to execute synchronous code 
        associate with asynchronous code. For instance, making a get request to google maps API is asynch, logging to stdout is 
        synch. Our sheduler is the event loop.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Event loop concept.
      </h2>

      <p>
        If we were using threads, and we had a separate thread for each async instruction, scheduling is not a problem,
        because when the instruction comes back with some output, we could interrupt our main thread and place the data 
        on the message queue. However, without threads, we have the problem of scheduling. Let's remember one thing - we 
        are working on an event stream which will tell us when some network call comes back. When that call comes back, 
        we can execute some code we passed as a callback on whatever the network data is. That callback is executed by 
        placing on a message queue. But this thing that places it on the queue - how does it know the network call 
        completed? Remember select()?
      </p>

      <p>        
        With select, we would loop through our registered file descriptors, and send back just the ones ready for a read
        or write
        operation, and this could be a thousand different files. However, with things like network events, we can place
        all network
        i/o events into one bucket - the network io bucket, and we can check that bucket, as well as other types of
        buckets. For
        instance, using setTimeout(callback, timeout) registers a function in the setTimeout bucket, and at the
        beginnign of every loop, we can
        check the current time, and if it is greater than the timeout, we can invoke the callback. Then we can check the
        other bucket,
        until we loop back around. That is the idea behind the event loop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Steps in our loop
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Check what time it is</li>
        <li>Check if timers set in setTimeout should invoke the callback</li>
        <li>Check if timer in setInterval should invoke the calback</li>
        <li>Check callbacks we may have postponed from last time</li>
        <li>Check for I/O events and their callbacks</li>
        <li>Check if there are any setImmediate callbacks to run</li>
        <li>Check for any close callbacks, such as connection.on('close'...</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        As you can see, there's a specific order, and some of it may leave you scratching your head. Why is setImmediate
        not the
        first step? Because I/O and timer callbacks often use setImmediate to make sure they delay certain code from
        happening,
        and we want to get to that code as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another question is, how does this talk to our little emulator? How do we get these callbacks to run, if we have
        synchronous
        code blocking on our call stack? Well, sometimes the call stack is empty, and that's when we check if there are
        any async
        callbacks to execute. You may assume we place these instructions on their own queue, and you're right, and we
        can call this
        queue the callback queue for now.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is what our model looks like now.
      </p>

      <img src="article-images/eventLoopDiagram.png" />

      <p>
        So far, we have sort of figured out how to place async code onto our sync call stack to execute it. We have a
        loop
        checking for async events to get done, then we place the callback associated with those events onto our sync
        callstack
        only when it is empty. This would explain this sort of code:
      </p>

      <pre>
      console.log('Script Start')
      setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log('First SetTimeout')
        setTimeout(()=>console.log('Second SetTimeout'), 0)
      }, 0)
      setTimeout(()=>console.log('Third SetTimeout'))
      console.log('Script End')

      // Output:
      // Script Start
      // Script End
      // First SetTimeout
      // Third SetTimeout
      // Second SetTimeout
    </pre>

      <p>
        Notice, our Script End message is printed, then we start with the setTimeouts. This is because until we pop the
        last
        sync instruction off the call stack, it is not empty, and the callback queue is not even checked. The first
        setTimeout
        make sense, but what is with the order of the next two? Shouldn't we execute them in order? The reason is that the
        event
        loop does not know about the second setTimeout callback until the first is invoked, and by that time, the third
        has
        already been appended onto the queue. Every time we take a callback off the queue and execute its code, we call
        this
        a <b>tick</b>. The first tick can be considered the sync code, the next is first setTimeout, and then the third
        and second.
      </p>

      <h2>Promises</h2>

      <p>
        So, we have these large tasks, but what about things like thenables? Remember writing a get request, and taking
        the
        response of an axios call that was a promise, doing something with it in a .then method, and it all happened in
        the order you wanted it
        to? Let's take a look at this code:
      </p>

      <pre>
        setTimeout(()=>{
          console.log('First SetTimeout')
          setTimeout(()=>console.log('Second SetTimeout'), 0)
        }, 0)
        
        Promise.resolve()
          .then(()=>console.log('First Then'))
          .then(()=>console.log('Second Then'))

        // Output:
        // First Then
        // Second Then
        // First SetTimeout
        // Second SetTimeout
      </pre>

      <p>
        We would expect the output to be much different. Our first tick should be the first time out, and our second the
        first then.
        However, this is clearly not happening. Let's add yet another queue, and now finally we are following the
        ecmascript 6 spec,
        and distinguishing between macrotasks (tasks in es6) and microtasks (jobs in es6). We are changing our callback
        queue to
        macrotask queue, and we are adding a microtask queue in the middle. The rules are, if we have anything in the
        microtask
        queue, put all of it on the callstack, and only then go back to the next tick. Meaning, we have a step at the
        end of each
        tick that checks the microtask queue. This is weird, because both a macrotask and a microtask can themselves add
        to the
        microtask queue, potentially blocking our event loop indefinitely.
      </p>

      <img src="article-images/eventLoopDiagram_2.png" />

      <p>
        The new rules are: callbacks passed to the then method on promises get pushed onto the micro task queue. So,
        if you do
        axios.get(...).then(res => console.log(res.data)), the network call itself is a macrotask that gets checked in
        the network I/O phase of the event loop. When this macrotask is resolved, it places the callback passed
        to .then onto the microtask queue, and so will invoke the console.log in the same tick as the network call. A
        shortcut to
        appending microtasks this way is simply to use Promise.resolve().then(callback), however this resolves
        synchronously, and therefore appends the callback onto the microtask queue of the synchronous tick.
      </p>

      <h2>process.nextTick</h2>

      <p>
        Another way to place callbacks onto the microtask queue of the current tick is to use process.nextTick(). That's
        right, today
        we learn that the people who designed these systems simply have no respect, and that's why they named the method
        that uses
        this tick as next tick, and the one that places on next tick as setImmediate. To add insult to injury,
        process.nextTick(callback)
        takes priority over anything else, and so will place its callback above Promise.resolve().then(callback), but
        will not supercede
        an earlier invocation of another process.nextTick().
      </p>

      <pre>
        process.nextTick(()=>console.log('First NextTick'))
        console.log('First Sync')
        setTimeout(()=>{
          Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log('First Promise'))
          console.log('First Timeout')

          setTimeout(()=>{
            Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log('Second Promise'))
            console.log('Second Timeout')
          }, 0)

        }, 0)

        Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log('Third Promise'))
        process.nextTick(()=>console.log('Second NextTick'))
        console.log('Second Sync')

        // Output
        // First Sync
        // Second Sync
        // First NextTick
        // Second NextTick
        // Third Promise
        // First Timeout
        // First Promise
        // Second Timeout
        // Second Promise
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the first tick, our sync tick, we print from First Sync to Third Promise. Remember, thenables place onto same
        tick
        as long as they resolve synchronously, and so does nextTick, but nextTicks take priority over promises in the
        order. In the
        second tick, we have First Timeout and First Promise, because setTimeout is a macrotask that gets its own tick,
        and also
        uses a promise to place a callback on the microtask queue which must be invoked before the next tick. This
        macrotask also
        calls another macrotask, the second setTimeout, which also uses a promise.
      </p>

      <h2>libuv</h2>

      <p>
        You might be thinking, what part of Nodejs is this? How is the event loop built? This part is called libuv, and it's written
        in c++.
        It can't be written in Javascript because JS doesn't have the tools to talk to the operating system that c++
        does, and is
        also slower.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may also be thinking, what's the point? Why promise.nextTick? Have you ever seen code like this?
      </p>

      <pre>
      app.connect()

      app.on('connect', ()=>console.log('app connected'))
    </pre>

      <p>
        How can we configure what to do on connect after the connect? If the connect method uses process.nextTick, it
        will always
        be run just after all of the synchronous code is popped off the call stack, and it will always be the first
        callback
        on the microtask queue. If we used setImmediate, we would actually have to wait for another tick, hurting
        performance.
      </p>

      <h2>V8</h2>

      <p>
        If the event loop is implemented in a library called libuv, what implements our emulator? What takes javascript,
        and turns
        into a queue of CPU instructions that we can push and pop off a call stack? That part is called V8, and it's a
        doozie. The
        first thing you need to know about V8 is that Google made it, so you know it's fast and complicated.
      </p>

      <h3>Compilation</h3>

      <p>
        You have heard me refer to an underlying language which is simply instructions for the CPU, and you know that
        Javascript
        is also a language. You also know that Javascript is optimized for certain things: readability, functional
        composition, ease
        of learning, but you know that speed is also something you must optimize for. If you optimize for things other
        than speed,
        you get those things at the cost of speed. So, how did Google make JS fast?
      </p>

      <p>
        An interpretted language, in the literal sense, is turned into CPU instructions line by line. Bash is
        interpretted, and so is
        python, which makes it easy to use - just type 'python3' into terminal, and you drop into the python3
        interpretter, which
        allows you to run a program line by line. However, we know that JS applications are large and we are no longer
        dealing with
        'scripts'. Node is also a server, and so must be reasonably efficient, or else will be too expensive to run at
        scale. How do you go about optimizing an interpretted language?
      </p>

      <p>
        Like we know of interpretted languages, we also know of languages that compile into a different language.
        Languages like c and
        go compile to either machine code, or something close to machine code. This means that we had a nice human
        readable language
        to write programs in, but when it came to running the programs, we compiled them into more efficient languages.
        If JS is compiled,
        how come I can't find the compiled code?
      </p>

      <h3>
        Ignition
      </h3>

      <p>
        What if, instead of interpretting line by line, or compiling the whole program, we interpretted it by chunks
        into something like
        machine code, then optimized on that code? The thing in V8 that changes Javascript to lower level code is called
        ignition, and
        that lower level code is called byte code. Right now we have high level, human readable code, and we have very
        low level machine
        code that is made of CPU instructions. Those instructions change from machine to machine, since there are many
        different instruction
        sets and their implementations on various machines. Byte code looks a lot like assembly language, except it
        doesn't map directly
        to a single machine's instructions, but to any machine's instructions. How it does that is abstracted away from
        us, but regardless
        it is very low level, and so we are able to optimize on top of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see, much lower level. Ignition however doesn't just translate JS into byte code as fast as it can,
        it helps the optimizers by keeping track of patterns in your code. For instance, JS doesn't care if you give a
        funcition a string or a number to operate on, since it's a loosely typed language, however if you are
        consistently calling a particular funcition on a certain data type, it will keep this information stored in
        something called the feedbackVector. After doing this, ignition will indeed interpret that byte code, so
        you very quickly see a representation of a webpage, even if it isn't optimized yet. If you run the script
        again later, V8 will use turbofan to optimize on the bytecode further using information stored in
        feedbackVector.
      </p>

      <h3>Turbofan</h3>

      <p>
        Turbofan is an 'optimizing compiler', and its job is to optimize your bytecode, specifically functions that you
        use over and over. These functions are called 'hot' code, and they are identified by something called a runtime
        profiler. The reason this thing is a big deal is that before we had something called crankshaft that did this
        job,
        however it had trouble with new ecma script updates, and was structured such that updating the language features
        that it optimized was difficult, because it didn't work on the byte code, but a stage between JS and bytecode
        called the parse tree. If you think your job is tedious, there are engineers at Google who sit around and
        optimize
        one JS language feature at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are confused as to what the order of things are, you're not alone. Turbofan is not just a set of
        optimizations,
        but actually has all the tools to do the job of executing and optimizing JS. It has a 'frontend' part that turns
        JS into
        byte code, an 'optimization' layer that works on that byte code, and a 'backend' layer that does some bytecode
        generation,
        and some optimization. Iginition uses the backend to do its job, and the reason it exists at all is that that
        latency
        of optimizing code on the first run through would mean that the user would see a small hickup before his page
        loads quickly.

      <h2>Bindings</23>

      <p>
        We've mentioned that a lot of nodejs is written in not Javascript. How is it that we can reference node in
        our scripts, then? JS has no way to talk to an operating systems files, for example, and yet node let's us do
        it. Since
        c++ does have access to these system calls, nodejs comes with a layer of c++ bindings that allow the JS code
        exposed in node
        to reference c++ language features. These are just another feature of node, which is described is an environment
        that
        combines libuv, V8, c++ bindings, and more to allow us to build servers out of Javascript.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, most people think they are done. However, there is one feature we only briefly mentioned, but one
        that is
        very important, and that's promises. Tune in next time, when we deconstruct promises and async/await, and wonder
        if there
        really is such a thing as too big.
