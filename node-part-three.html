      <h1>How node actually works, part 3: Promises and async/await</h1>
      <p>
       It's been a long journey boys and girls, but buckle up, the ride is about to get rougher. We are getting into cartoonish levels
       of large wooden platform energy, and even though we can only go down from here, we are going to keep challenging ourselves. We've
       gone over how the operating system constructs an event stream for our event loop to demultiplex in 
       <a href="https://medium.com/@igor.atakhanov/how-node-actually-works-part-1-the-operating-system-497fd0de8167">
        Part One
      </a>,
        then we went over how Turbofan and Igninition both compile and interpret your Javascript, and the hows and whys of the event loop
        in <a href="node-part-two.html">Part Two</a>. But we still need go over why promises exist and how they are implemented.
